# K-Means-and-Hierarchical-Clustering-
Performed K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering on Car Sales Dataset

Data Mining is the process of discovering patterns in the large data sets and finding the correlations among them in order to predict the outcomes. Data Mining can be performed through various techniques such as Classification, Regression, Prediction, Pattern Tracking etc. In this assignment, the data mining technique which is opted is Clustering Analysis. In order to perform Clustering Analysis, the Cars Sales dataset has been opted. This dataset contains 157 entries along with 15 column variables. The dataset contains information about the different car models manufactured by different companies. The dataset contains information such as sales, prices, resale value, engine size, wheelbase, length, width along with the launch date of the car models. The URL of the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/hsinha53/car-sales/version/1#Car_sales.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/hsinha53/car-sales/version/1#Car_sales.csv)
